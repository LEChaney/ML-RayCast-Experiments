The models uploaded in this directory are models saved during training process. For eg. the file "model_updates2000" is the saved model after 2000 epochs of training.

So, "model_updates0" is the initial model generated for starting training process and "model_updates9500" is the last model generated during training process, after which training was manually stopped.
